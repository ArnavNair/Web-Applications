	<p>Dogs have not always held a special place in the hearts of their human companions.
	Their role among humans was mostly utilitarian until the 18th century, when the term "man's best friend" came into the vocabulary of a person.
	Their working roles are reduced today, but their importance at home has only increased. From pets to sporting companions to service dogs,
	canines add a measurable degree of quality to the worlds of the humans they share their lives with.<br>
	Companionship:
	Dogs provide companionship and company. They can be a comfort to people who crave unconditional interaction with another living being.
	Dogs can decrease levels of human loneliness and give humans a sense of purpose as they care for their animal companions.
	This can be especially beneficial for people who live alone, don't socialize much, are empty-nesters or recently experienced a major change of life,
	such as the loss of a close human companion to death or divorce.<br>
	Stress Reduction and Health Benefits:
	Dogs can help reduce stress levels in human beings and are often used for therapeutic purposes in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices.
	Playing with a dog, exercising, walking or running can help human beings reduce stress levels and increase their health and well-being.
	Studies show dog interaction with humans can help combat challenges associated with some form of heart disease and autism.</p>
